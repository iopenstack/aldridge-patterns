Aldridge-patterns
=================

This is a project that tries to recreate a set of rhythmic examples 
from [Elements of Rhythm](http://www.theelementsofrhythm.com/) by David Aldridge.
It is an exercise in the context of a series of posts on [Scores of Beauty](http://lilypondblog.org) 
discussing the advantages of a plain text approach when creating this kind of systematic score material.

This series was triggered by a post by Janek Warchoł:  
[Less Blatant Marketing, Please?](http://lilypondblog.org/2013/07/less-blatant-marketing-please/)

Currently only the first post is published:  
[“Creating Anything You Can Imagine With Finale”](http://lilypondblog.org/2013/07/creating-anything-you-can-imagine-with-finale/)

The second post: “Programmatically Generating LilyPond Input” is currently in review, 
and a last post is currently being worked on (within the LilyPond source in this repository).
